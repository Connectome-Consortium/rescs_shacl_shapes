This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but rather as a high level summary for dataset discovery. For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: \\\"mass spectrometry\\\" or \\\"nmr spectroscopy\\\" or \\\"colorimetry\\\" or \\\"immunofluorescence\\\". If the [[variableMeasured]] is \\\"depression rating\\\", the [[measurementTechnique]] could be \\\"Zung Scale\\\" or \\\"HAM-D\\\" or \\\"Beck Depression Inventory\\\". If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]].",
